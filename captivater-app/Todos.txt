THINGS TO DO

CURRENT GOAL: load sentence images


I want to cycle through the words which have images related to them
highlight them (by adding styles) and display the associated image.


UPCOMING GOALS
-Look pretty
-load faster
-determine css structure for images 
-(how to loop cleanly? use a set timeout and animate.css)
-get textillate working again

SANATIZE INPUT
-add a period if last sentence doesn't end with punctuation

-get refresh page to not fail miserably
-general site navigation // settings page

-highlight words that have associated images 
-dynamic highlighting

HOW TO SPEED LOADING TIME
-only get the images for the first two sentences.
-when the user hits next, make an ajax request to grab images for the next sentence.


ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY
- different language conversion w/ Google translate API
- speed up url fetching with "chapter" or "sectioning" 
- the ability to save and share stories with other users
- display the whole paragraph on the side as a minimap
- parent mode: creating a blacklist of naughty words


-add omniauthable to users model
-omniauth good for allowing users to sign in with facebook or twitter


ARCHITECTURE:

textblock
title, body, references a user

url 
url, word, references a textblock
